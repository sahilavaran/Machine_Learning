AI Vs ML Vs DL

artificial inteligence- artificial inteligence is a branch of computer science that is concerned with building smart and intelligent machines

non intelligent machines: non intelligent machines are machines that are not capable of learning and making decisions based on data. Non intelligent machines are machines that are like watches, calculators, and other machines that are not capable

inteligent machines are machines that are capable of learning and making decisions based on data. Intelligent machines are machines that are like humans, animals, cars, google assistant, and other machines that are capable of learning and making decisions based on data.

Machine Learning: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is a technique of training machines to learn and make decisions based on data. Machine learning is a method of training algorithms to learn from data and make decisions. Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. It is a technique of training machines to learn and make decisions based on data. Machine learning is a method of training algorithms to learn from data and make decisions.

(we give a lot of data to the machine and the machine learns from the data and makes decisions based on the data)

Deep Learning: Deep learning is a subset of machine learning which uses artificial neural networks to learn from the data.
