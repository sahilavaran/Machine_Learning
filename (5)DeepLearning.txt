    machine learning vs deep learning

 in machine learning for example we need to tell them when we take a car it has 4 wheels and all deep learning its powerfull we dont need to tell anything it can detect itself

 HOW DEEP LEARNING GETS MORE POPULAR

 (there is a famous comany called DeepMind its is basaed in US. )
