# Supervised Learning = in supervised learning, the machine learning algorithm learns from labelled data
for example giving images and trainig thats how the supervised works

Types of Supervised learning are Classification and Regression

1.Classification = classification is about predicting a class of discrete values (examples male or female , true or false)

another example in real life we give dog picture and the cat one and label it thats how classification works. There is no middle value 
(here we predict the class or type )

Classification algorithms
1.Decision Tree Classification
2.Random Forest Classification
3.K-nearest Neighbor

2.Regression = is about predicting a quntity or continues values (example salary, age, price)

another example in real life we need to check the temperature (here we are trying to find a number )

Regression algorithms
1. logistic Regression
2.Polynomial Regression
3.Support Vector machinesk
