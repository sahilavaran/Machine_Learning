UNSUPERVISED LEARNING = The machine learning algorithm learns from unlabelled data.

it can group the data from one picture, if the picture contains 2 different items.
. it automatically find the pattern between those images
we are not giving any supervision here 

Types of UNSUPERVISED are clustering and association

1.clustering is an unsupervised task which involves grouping the similar data points
for example in real life( a network company checks that who makes more calls have less usage of internet and those who use more internet have less call usage so with these they can give offers on vise verse)
here we above we cluster the data based on the user data


2.Association is an unsupervised task that is used to find important relationship between data points.

for example in real life example we can consider supermarket there are severl customers who are buying same things like milk, bread, fruits 

there are other customers who buying similar bread, milk, butter

the association here is when people buy milk they buy bread too this is the association here

## what are the  important unsupervised learning algorithm
