Machine learning is a technique to implement AI that can learn from the data by themselves without being explictly programmed.

THREE TYPES OF MACHINE learning

1.SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING
there is some supervison by programmeres for algorithams learns from the labeled data (for example they provide more picture of apples to learn these are apples. we are giving supervision in terms of labels)

2. UNSUPERVISED LEARNING 
There is no supervision for the Machine.they learn from unlabelled data. for example we give apple and mangoes and we wont tell them its apples and mangoes and what does is its groups and seperates it 

3.REINFORCEMENT LEARNING
ITS completely a different type.
its an area of machine learning concerned with how intelligent agents take actions in an enviornment to maximise its rewards
Imagine you have a pet dog, and you're trying to teach it a new trick. You might use a combination of rewards (like treats or praise) and punishments (like a stern "no") to guide its behavior. Reinforcement learning is similar to this process.

Here's the breakdown:

Agent: This is the "learner" – it could be a robot, a computer program, or even your dog!
Environment: The world the agent interacts with.
Actions: The things the agent can do in the environment.
Rewards: Positive feedback for doing something good.
Punishments: Negative feedback for doing something bad.
The agent's goal is to learn the best way to behave in the environment by trying different actions and seeing what rewards it gets. Over time, it learns to choose actions that lead to the most rewards.

Think of it like a game:

Imagine a video game where you control a character. You explore the game world, try different things, and get points for completing quests or finding treasures. The more you play, the better you get at figuring out the best way to win the game. That's essentially how reinforcement learning works!

Here's a simple example:

Let's say you're teaching a robot to walk. You might give it a small reward every time it takes a step forward, and a small punishment if it falls down. Over time, the robot will learn to take more steps forward and fall down less often.

Real-world applications:

Reinforcement learning is used in many different areas, including:

Robotics: Teaching robots to walk, grasp objects, and navigate environments.
Game playing: Creating computer programs that can play games like chess or Go at a very high level.
Artificial intelligence: Developing AI systems that can learn and make decisions in complex situations.
Key concepts:

Exploration vs. exploitation: The agent needs to explore the environment to find new rewards, but it also needs to exploit what it already knows to get the most rewards.
Delayed rewards: Sometimes, the agent might have to take a series of actions before getting a reward. This makes it harder to learn, because the agent needs to figure out which actions led to the reward.
In a nutshell:

Reinforcement learning is a powerful technique that allows agents to learn how to behave in complex environments by trial and error. It's like teaching a dog a new trick, or learning to play a video game – you try different things, get feedback, and gradually learn the best way to succeed.
